## Software Architecture and the Future for Software Developers (Especially If You Wanna Build a SaaS)

I have two things I strongly feel about the future of code and my career:

### 1. Code Is Becoming a Cheap Commodity

AI is now churning out high-quality code. The days of the programmer are slowly fading. Soon, weâ€™ll be telling AI what to write, and then just read it, check for bugs and then use AI to run tests on AI-generated code.

What this means is:
- Thereâ€™s less value in writing code,
- More value in understanding the *context* where that code is needed,
- And even more value in **organizing that code** so itâ€™s easy to maintain and evolve.

### 2. Most Devs Arenâ€™t Indie Hackers â€” Hereâ€™s Why

I also believe the reason why there is many of us developers but very few startup indie-hackers is because few of us understand **systems architecture** and how to design models that support a business.

We might know how to lay bricks, but the real value lies in **pioneering the structure** where bricklaying is necessary.

There are millions of devs, but only a few actual startup builders. Why? Because most of us are trained to execute, not to design.

You can lay bricks â€” cool. But can you imagine the building? Can you sketch the whole city? Thatâ€™s the real skill.

## So I Took a Dive Into Systems Design and Architecture

### It Started Here:

**[5 Things Every Developer Must Know About Software Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzp0PGVegHA) â€” Simon Brown** 

Simon Brown is a genius. His delivery is chill and his insights cut deep.

#### **THE KEY TAKEAWAY IS SIMPLE:**

- Know what you want to build.
- Know if itâ€™s actually worth building.

(*So simple, but the real question is are we doing it right*)

## The Developerâ€™s Cheat Sheet (Straight from the Lecture)

### 1. Software Architecture Is NOT About Big Design Upfront

This part literally broke my heart, because just last semester at uni, I was cramming this diagram for software planning and architecture â€” the same one Simon Brown happily slams while quoting Dr. Winston W. Royce:

> "I believe in this concept (from the '90s), but the implementation above is risky and invites failure."

Imagine that! And this is still the stuff weâ€™re being taught in 2025. On paper it looks good so organised that its tempting


### So Whatâ€™s The Alternative To Not Having a Big Design Plan?

- Respond to change over following a plan.
- Just because you shouldnâ€™t do big design upfront doesnâ€™t mean **no design** is the alternative.
- Begin with a **primitive whole** (an MVP), then evolve it.

The advantage? You get feedback fast, develop faster, and ship even faster.

> "Your initial design isnâ€™t about creating a master plan â€” itâ€™s about creating direction. Establishing a starting point. Arranging a room just good enough for your dev efforts or team to settle in."

### 2. Architecture Is a Process

Itâ€™s not a one-off diagram you email and ghost. Itâ€™s a **living system**.

- Feedback from code â†’ redesign â†’ iterate.
- If youâ€™re calling yourself a software architect and not touching codeâ€¦ respectfully, youâ€™re LARPing.

### 3. Every Team Needs a Technical Leader

If thatâ€™s you â€” own it.
- Learn the **breadth** (business, dev, user needs).
- Master the **depth** (code, performance, domain logic).

If youâ€™re solo: sharpen both blades.

### 4. Forget UML â€” Just Use a Whiteboard

UML = Universal Modeling Language (and yeah, it sucks).

Instead:
- Just draw.
- Use a whiteboard.
- Sketch relatable diagrams for what you want to build.

It goes back to: **you should know what you want to build.**

Your diagrams should be **understandable**, even to non-technical people.

#### Simonâ€™s Go-To? The C4 Model:
- **Context**
- **Containers**
- **Components**
- **Code**

Draw what matters. Make it relatable.

You can check Simon Brown's video on C4 Model [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYzOc7vI-Uo)

**NB:** You arenâ€™t chasing perfection â€” youâ€™re chasing mental clarity.

## Final Word

The main objective of software architecture is to structure stuff that is **significant** and foundational to your core software design.

And whatâ€™s *significant*?
> Anything thatâ€™s expensive to change later.

Think deeply about this:
- How long or how much will it cost you to change whatever item you put in your design?

Thatâ€™s your north star.

I believe the future belongs to **System Thinkers**.

I run a small Discord for system thinkers â€” devs who care about architecture, clarity, and building real things.
