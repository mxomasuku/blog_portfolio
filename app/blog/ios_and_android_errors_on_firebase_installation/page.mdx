# iOS and Android Errors After Installing Firebase in Your Project

Setting up Firebase in Flutter is pretty intuitive — simple, really. You only have to [follow these docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios#next_steps) to get there.

The problem, however, starts when you’ve done this:

```dart
void main() async {
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

…and you hit `flutter run`. You’ll likely encounter two errors related to Firebase. Here’s how to handle them properly.

>  Assumes your `pubspec.yaml` has the necessary firebase_* packages set, and you’ve verified with:
> ```bash
> flutter doctor -v
> ```

You can also check the platform-specific deployment docs:
- [Android](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#review-the-gradle-build-configuration)
- [iOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios)
- [macOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/macos)

## Android

###  Error:

```
PlatformException(channel-error,
Unable to establish connection on channel: 
"dev.flutter.pigeon.firebase_auth_platform_interface.FirebaseAuthHostApi.registerIdTokenListener")
```

### Fix:

This error is caused by a mismatch between Flutter’s configured NDK version and Firebase’s minimum required NDK version.

Open: `android/app/build.gradle.kts`

```kotlin
android {
    namespace = "com.example.mockify"
    compileSdk = flutter.compileSdkVersion
    ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973" // <- update to minimum required
    defaultConfig {
        minSdk = 23 // <- required by Firebase Auth
    }
}
```

Also run:

```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

## iOS

### Problem:

You’ve updated your deployment target in Xcode but Firebase still complains.

### Fix:

1. Open your project in Xcode:

```bash
cd ios && open Runner.xcworkspace
```

2. Then in `ios/Podfile`, update this line:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0' # <- set to Firebase's required minimum
```

3. Clean and rebuild everything:

```bash
flutter clean
rm ios/Podfile.lock
rm -rf ios/Pods
rm -rf ios/.symlinks
rm -rf ios/Flutter/Flutter.framework
rm -rf ios/Flutter/Flutter.podspec
flutter pub get
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

## Long-Term Maintenance

Every time you update Firebase dependencies or Flutter SDK:

```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

Re-check:
- `minSdkVersion` (Android)
- `platform :ios` (iOS)
- `ndkVersion` (Android)
