Coming from a React background and the nightmare that came with useEffect, componentDidMount and other Component related nightmares,
I made it a point to understand the Flutter Widget Lifecycle. I imagine my understanding of the basics in theory will
be key in driving how I optimize my app perfomance and handle conditional rendering. (No different from React I hope)


## We start here:

There are 3 key method/functions to understand in the Widget Lifecycle:
1. initState()
2. build()
3. dispose()


### initState()
 initState as the name suggests is for initialising state. But more specifically, in Stateful Widget.

#### Anatomy of initState()
`initState() {`

`super.initState()`

`}`

## Good vs Bad Practices in Flutter

| **Good Practices** | **Bad Practices** |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Use `initState()` for one-time initialization, 
call methods that are required only once in a widget 
lifecycle. | ❌ Don't call `setState` inside `initState()`. You can't set state inside a widget that isn't fully initialized. |
| Always call `super.initState()`. Don't worry about this though, it normally comes built-in, your only job is to **NOT** delete it. | ❌ Don't make an `async` call inside `initState()`, use a separate method. |
| Use widget bindings to handle content-dependent actions, like listeners and animation controllers. | ❌ Don't access `BuildContext` directly in `initState()`. |
| ✅ Use `late` initialization for expensive objects instead of recreating them. | ❌ Don't recreate expensive objects unnecessarily. |
| ✅ Keep inherited widgets immutable when initializing a widget. | ❌ Don't modify inherited widgets during initialization. |
| Don't modify inherited widgets when initialising a widget                                                    |     |

## build()

The build() method is executed when the widget is built and called after setState() is called


## dispose()
called right before a conditionally rendered widget is destroyed
