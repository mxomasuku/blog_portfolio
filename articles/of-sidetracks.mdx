Let's start with some cliches! 
"if you fail to plan, you plan to fail."

Today's update concerns roadmaps and why they are necessary for learning, especially when you have little control over your time or your day is fragmented.

This [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1R5BLgLOMRGtI7cU6C87SF?si=77f7507953b24c65) on Time Management was a huge wake-up call for me. 

## Back to the basics: Roadmap

When I started, when I was still learning (past tense?) and didn't know what to do, I had a roadmap to help, funny how I am back to that again. 
Now I am interested in Mastery, going for those boogeyman concepts in Typescript, React and Next.

## What I am working on now,

Before doing the deep-dive into Next, I first had to plunge into Typescript, this is my [playground ](https://github.com/mxomasuku/typescript/)repo. Still in its infancy, but will be maintained every day! 30 days of Typescript on my terms, my way.

Found this [great resource for learning Typescript through challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges) . Great for the mind 

Maybe its time to revisit that one book: _Learning How To Learn_
