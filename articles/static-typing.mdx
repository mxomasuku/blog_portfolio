"People hire people for the personalities, skills and career orientation they display."

This is the one lesson I held very dear and also, this is the lesson that kept me in fear of publishing this blog. However, here I am and time to go!!

## The three goals behind this
1. Create evergreen notes for the technologies/tools I am working with.
2. Demonstrate my knowledge and test it as I write and learn.
3. Test out the benefits of learning in public

## Where am I now?

The date is 22 July, I am starting a refresher course on Next 14. The last time I touched Next was when 13 was still being rolled out
and the `App Dir` was still an experimental feature. For the past 1 year I had been working mainly with  `Create React App` on the front on my first
Upwork contract - rather my first dev job. 

So the learning starts here, a refresher on Next and Typescript concurrently, lets see how it goes. 


## ...More to come.....
