Is there a better way of accessing the reality/function of a thing than metaphors and analogies?

The tree of life,
Tutorial Hell,
React Components and their parent-child relationships

...the list goes on! 

The thing about metaphors however is that they eventually fail, at a certain higher level of interaction that is. However, when you see how a metaphor or analogy fails, it would have already
done its job of making you a see different side of said thing. And again, not all metaphors are equal, and metaphors can be weaponised against you if you encounter a manipulative person.

However, lets stick to code. This is about code.

This is essentially what brought me to this conversation
